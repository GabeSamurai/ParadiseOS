# ParadiseOS
This is a sort of "file system" implementation of the ParadiseOS project, albeit heavily modified. I wont be
giving the full explanation about the the stuff but i will link in the place where you can understand the concept, and
tell where my controls diverge from theirs.

## Quick Check
a) "note", "look", "pass" and "learn" were removed.  
b) "program" was renamed to "learn".  
c) "script" and "follow" primitives were added.  
d) "create create" is allowed.  
e) "transform" destroy the current vessel.  
f) "transform" can be called on the habited vessel, in this case, the current vessel will be reseted.  
g) "script" 

## "transform"

The reasons for the change in the transform primitive were two fold. First, from what i could understand, each vessel
is a entity on it's own, with the name not being a label but the very representation of the vessel identity. Such is
that such vessel exist by it's own rights, programs and vessels inside it.  

## Proposed New Nomenclature
Name: FactoryOS  
Primitives: buid - equip - access
