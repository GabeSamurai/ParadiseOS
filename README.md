# ParadiseOS
This is a sort of "file system" implementation of the ParadiseOS project, albeit heavily modified. I wont be
giving the full explanation about the the stuff but i will link in the place where you can understand the concept, and
tell where my controls diverge from theirs.

## Quick Check
a) "note", "look", "pass" and "learn" were removed.  
b) "program" was renamed to "learn".  
c) "script" and "follow" primitives were added.  
d) "create create" is allowed.  
e) "transform" destroy the current vessel.  
f) "transform" can be called on the habited vessel, in this case, the current vessel will be reseted.  
g) "script" 

## "transform"

The reasons for the change in the transform primitive were two fold. First, the paradise logic design state that
each vessel is a entity that exist independely from one another and also from the "force". This is evident by the fact
that the force can "become" a vessel, and afterwards, cease to be it without the anihilation of the vessel. As such, becoming
here is analogous with wearing a vessel like cloth or "possesing" it, in exorcist terms. In fact not only it is implied that
the vessel never ceases to be in the process of something becoming it, one cannot give the same name to two different vessels, even
if they are inside different vessels. Also, the original transform primitive demostrated that, it
by itself was a incomplete combination of the primitives "lllllllllllllllllllllll

The old way is not by itself inferior, just different. In my case i value logic uniformity and singularity, for personal taste and because
it make it easyer distan itsellllllllllllllllllllllllll.llllllllllllllllllll

First, each vessel is a real in this fictional reality of the
library and the primitives are the common behaviour from what i could understand, each vessel
is a entity on it's own, with the name not being a label but the very representation of the vessel identity. Such is
that a vessel exist by it's own right, with it's own programs and vessels inside it. The ability to rename a vessel breaks 
the logic behind this library "reality", in which the name is the simulation of a vessel individuality, as such, the name of
the vessel is the vessel itself. This is what i understood, and the very essence of the primitive "become" confirmed my
analisys. In short, the idea of this primitive is that of a "force" becoming a vessel, but the vessel exist on it's 
own right. 

This is what differs it from a directory/file behavior


## Proposed New Nomenclature
Name: FactoryOS  
Primitives: buid - equip - access
